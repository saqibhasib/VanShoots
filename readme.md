## Project Introduction
VanShoots is a web application developed for the SFU CSSS Fall Hacks Hackathon by Team 4heads. This app gives tourists a social experience about the movies that were shot in Vancouver. Verified users can post pictures using the app to share where they saw a movie being shot, so that cinephile tourists can visit those exact places.
